This project was bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

Using as a base for upcoming projects

Am using rundis/elm-bootstrap (which also showed how to use elm url navigation):

Have included Auth0 for authentication, originally based on their example code - have tried to keep as much of this as possible in one file in case anyone wants to make sense of it.
